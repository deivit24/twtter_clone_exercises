# twtter_clone_exercises

A Twitter clone with a Springboard spin!

This is a 2-3 day exercise to extend a somewhat-functioning Twitter clone. It is intended to give me practice reading and understanding an existing application, as well as fixing bugs in it, writing tests for it, and extending it with new features.

### Bugs that were fixed 

- Emplemented a logout route with a flash message
- Fixed User Profile by adding the user bio, location, and header image
- Added bio on the user cards
- Added Edit buttons throughout the site the brings you to the edit user route
- Fixed Homepage for logged in users and no users
- Added likes
- Added Unit Tests
